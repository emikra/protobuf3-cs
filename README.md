# protobuf 3 for .NET Framework 3.5

This is a _use-at-your-own-risk_ fork of the Protocol Buffers C# implementation for .NET 3.5 framework compatibility. The project builds the `Google.Protobuf.dll` library. It is based on the [**v3.1.x**](https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/3.1.x) branch from the [official project](https://github.com/google/protobuf) from Google.

    Install-Package protobuf3 -Pre
